This gem implements the observer pattern [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)[[2]](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer) (also known as publish/subscribe). It provides a simple mechanism for one object to inform a set of interested third-party objects when its state changes.

Ruby's standard library [has an abstraction](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.1/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html) that enables you to use this pattern. But its design can conflict with other mainstream libraries, like the [`ActiveModel`/`ActiveRecord`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Dirty.html#method-i-changed), which also has the [`changed`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.1/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html#method-i-changed) method. In this case, the behavior of the Stdlib will be been compromised.

Because of this issue, I decided to create a gem that encapsulates the pattern without changing the object's implementation so much. The `Micro::Observers` includes one instance method and two static methods.

# Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile and `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem 'u-attributes'
```

# Compatibility

| u-attributes   | branch  | ruby     |  activerecord |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 0.9.0          | main    | >= 2.2.0 | >= 3.2, < 6.1 |

> **Note**: The ActiveRecord isn't a dependency, but the static methods that are included by the gem were designed to be used with its [callbacks](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html).
